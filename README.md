##APP IDEA:
My app would be a travel companion. One that would use the power of AI and geolocalization to provide the user with fun facts and historical information based on the region of the world that they are visiting. 
    They would also be able to look for facts about other regions as well if they choose to.
            
    

## Notes

The main challenge was getting used to the different functionnality of XCODE. It is still a work in progress.
